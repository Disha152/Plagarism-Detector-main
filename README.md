The Python Plagiarism Detection GitHub repository contains a tool for detecting plagiarism in text files using different algorithms. The tool takes two or more text files as input and generates a report containing the similarity percentage between them. The algorithms used in this tool include cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and Levenshtein distance. The tool also provides an option to customize the threshold for similarity percentage. The repository contains the source code of the tool and detailed instructions on how to use it. It can be useful for educators and researchers who want to check for plagiarism in student assignments or research papers.
